### Why create this ?

I have always been fascinated by highly animated websites and wanted to create one or create cool effects , So tried to compile my blogs,components in one project through mdx , worked around on few solutions but found this stack to be helpful.

- Nextjs + Typescript for ease in developing ,`seo is easy.`
- Using Velite for MDX usage and creating pages at build time , `contentlayer sucks.`
- TailwindCSS, Shadcn for ease in styling over large files ,`tailwind is addicting.`
- Framer motion for handling animations , `gsap is tough.`
- Email service from emailJS , `as it's free.`
- Using next-view-transitions , `tried other alternatives found this to be best`
- Inspo taken from [aceternityUI](https://www.aceternity.com/), [magicUI](https://magicui.design/), [syntaxUI](https://syntaxui.com/) and others , `using some base files from these`

Started this as a Blogging app but velite is so helpful, that I became inspired to create my own custom component library. After seeing how other UI libraries were built, I realized there was room to craft something unique that suited my vision.
 
Drawing from these inspirations, I started working on a library that would integrate animation, style, and ease of use in a way that resonates with modern web development practices, while keeping a focus on customization and performance.
