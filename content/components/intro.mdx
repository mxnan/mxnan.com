### Why create this ?

In the process of working with Framer Motion, React, and TailwindCSS, Iâ€™ve discovered powerful techniques and patterns that simplify complex animations and UI development. I created this library to share those insights and help developers:

- Simplify Motion & Interaction: Making complex animations easy and accessible for everyone.
- Promote Reusability: Providing pre-built, customizable components that save time and effort in UI/UX design.
- Learn Together: Building in public allows me to share what I learn, gather feedback, and grow this library into a valuable resource for the community.
- Create Seamless Experiences: Combining the best of motion, design, and utility-driven styling into a single cohesive toolkit for modern web apps.

This library is not just about providing tools, but also about contributing to the developer ecosystem by encouraging open collaboration, iteration, and innovation.
