### Why create this ?

I have always been fascinated by highly animated websites and wanted to create one or create cool effects , So tried to compile my blogs,components in one project through mdx , worked around on few solutions but found this stack to be helpful.

- Nextjs + Typescript for ease in developing ,`seo is easy.`
- Using Velite for MDX usage and creating pages at build time , `contentlayer sucks.`
- TailwindCSS, Shadcn for ease in styling over large files ,`tailwind is addicting.`
- Framer motion for handling animations , `gsap is tough.`
- Email service from emailJS , `as it's free.`
- Inspo taken from **aceternityUI**, **magicUI**, **syntaxUI** and others , `using some base files from these`
